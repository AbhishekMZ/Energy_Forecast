# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### What is the Energy Forecast Platform?
The Energy Forecast Platform is a machine learning-based system designed to predict and optimize energy consumption across Indian cities. It uses advanced algorithms including LSTM, XGBoost, and Transformer models to provide accurate forecasts.

### Which cities are supported?
The platform currently supports major Indian cities and is continuously expanding its coverage. Check the [city_coverage.md](./city_coverage.md) document for the latest list of supported cities.

### What is the prediction accuracy?
Our ensemble model achieves:
- MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error): < 5%
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error): < 2.5 MWh
- RMSE (Root Mean Square Error): < 3.0 MWh

## Technical Questions

### What technologies does the platform use?
- Backend: Python, FastAPI
- ML: TensorFlow, PyTorch, XGBoost
